Data Fetching

1. Server side rendering (SSR).
--> Dynamic server render data.
--> Each request to the server render the page.

2. Static Site Generation (SSG).
--> It will automaticly catch the data.
This is recommended for content that not change frecuently like blog bosts, marketing pages.

3. Incremental Static Generation (ISR).
Instead of messing with the cache the data will be cached after a period of time, it combines the benefits of the two others methods. 

Next.js Supports the following HTTP methods:
1. **GET**: Retrieves data or resources from the server.
2. **POST**: Submit data to the server to create a new resource.
3. **PUT**: Updates or replaces an existing resource on the server.
4. **PATCH**: Partially updates an existing resource on the server.
5. **DELETE**: Removes a specific resource from the server.
6. **HEAD**: Retrieves the supported HTTP methods and other comunication options for a resource.
